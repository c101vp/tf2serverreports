# tf2serverreports
I couldn't really find a good plugin to report players so here's my janky solution
# Reporting Players:
[Click here](https://github.com/c101vp/tf2serverreports/issues) and create a new issue to report a player. You should see a template, please follow the template.
Make sure to put in the steam player's steam profile link as well as evidence (screenshots, videos) of whatever you're trying to report (be it cheating, slurs, or whatever else). A username means nothing since it can be changed at any time and a report without evidence also means nothing because I have nothing to base my punishment off.
